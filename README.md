# Gnome 1.0 for Arch Linux
Several Gnome packages from 1998 - 2000, patched to build on modern systems and packaged for Arch Linux.

## Installation
To install, enter a package directory and execute `makepkg`.
Some packages have dependencies on other packages.
In such a case, build and install the other package first.

## Package naming
Most packages have the same name as the directory there in.
However, some packages have `-old` appended to the end of their name in order to prevent conflicts with the current version of the package.
